cin >>, acts as getline, perhaps an oversimplification...

limitations are: cin cannot directly parse ints requires atoi() for math processing

cout hex requires cout.hex() or decimal cout.dec() instead of cout, will upgrade it soon...

todo, implement page scrolling using interrupts

then ACHI and xHCI
